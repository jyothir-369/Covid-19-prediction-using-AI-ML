# 🦠 COVID-19 Prediction Using AI & ML

This project uses **machine learning techniques** to analyze and predict the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. It leverages real-world data on infections, recoveries, and deaths to build models that forecast future case counts and support decision-making for healthcare organizations and policymakers.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

- 🔹 **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
  Real-world data from reliable sources (e.g., JHU, WHO). Cleaned and formatted for ML pipelines.

- 🔹 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualized trends in infection rates, death rates, and recoveries using line plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.

- 🔹 **Predictive Modeling**  
  Built multiple ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to forecast future COVID-19 trends.

- 🔹 **Visualization & Insights**  
  Generated charts and visual summaries to explain trends and predictions in an intuitive way.
